HanDrum
=======
**Requies PyGame and X11.**


HanDrum is a multitouch application that emulates an acoustic hand drum. It recognizes the location and way in which 
the player strikes the surface of the 'instrument' in order to acurately reproduce the appropriate sound.

The application may be tested on a MacBook or any other device with a multitouch trackpad. A TUIO wrapper, such as
Tongseng, is necessary.
